# Free project 1

## The user and a language
This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.


### What's the need?
_Organization of to do lists. It's easy to think of a to do list based on a broad
category (by room, by class, etc.) but it's then hard to see the most efficient 
way of doing the tasks._


### Why a language?
_A language allows for a broad amount of personalization, so that this can 
meet the needs of a large userbase. Additionally, hopefully the language 
would be able to give the user multiple options of a to do list. If it seems 
daunting to do certain tasks in a row,_


### Why you?
_I like that this can be a way to optimize time for a large group of people. I
thought of it because I ride horses with the Claremont Equestrian Team. On show
days, we have to get horses ready through a multitude of tasks per horse, from 
grooming the horses to warming them up. We will often have very short, stressful
periods followed by long period of time with almost nothing to do. By using a 
language like this one, we would be able to assign everyone tasks where they know 
about how long it will take them. Hopefully, this will eliminate the short, 
stressful periods with longer, calmer periods. This will help both the people and 
horses._


### Domain
_Organized, prioritized to do lists_


### Interface (syntax)
_The user should be able to input their to do list based on categories. They
should be able to input this list and, possibly, also their schedule so that 
the user can determine when these tasks should be done._ 


### Operation (semantics)
_When the program runs, it should take the categories of the to do list and
figure out the best way to organize the tasks for the most efficient use of time.
So, there would be optimizations involved as well as an understanding of the
tasks and their priorities from the lists given by the user._


### Expressiveness
_It would be very easy to work with lists, doing everything from looping through
them to editing them when tasks are complete. It would be difficult to work with
variables or other sorts of data structures. It would be impossible to _


### Related work
_I don't think there are any DSLs currently that meet this need. There are
DSLs that work with lists, but none that fit this domain specifically._


## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.


### Suitability
_Most would probably be language design decision based on the semantics
of building the language. Hopefully once the strcture of the language
is there, the other language design decisions would be implemented
based on what is appropriate for that structure. Because all of it is
so connected in hopes of delivering one product, all maintenance and
new features would have to interface well with all the old features._


### Scope
_This is probably my biggest worry. I worry that this project may be too
broad and trying to do too many things. However, even one part of this
project may be interesting to implement._


### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea 
project?_
