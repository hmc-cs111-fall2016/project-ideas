## The user and a language
The first language I would like to consider is one for music composers. It would help them organize ideas about compositions into structures they create, simulating a top-down approach to composing music.


### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help 
them?_

My idea satisfies the need of organization when composing music. We will be helping composers of any skill level organize their compositions. The main reason why I'd like to build a language for organizing composition structures is because a current person's experiences in composing is done on paper or in a language not built for organizing composition structures. There are a lot (like, really, a lot) of langauges that focus on creating music and aiding musicians. But I haven't come across one solely dedicated to organization yet. I hope that the language I am thinking of helps people efficiently organize their thoughts in compositions and frees them to think of other aspects of composing music such as harmony, rhythm, and textures. From here, the hope is that the less time spent thinking about organization leads to more time/efficiency on the other aspects.

### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

One reason why I see a DSL as a potential solution is because current music software includes a lot of other things. Many programming languages, libraries, and APIs that implement ways to create music focus on making it possible to make cool sounds and patterns. But instead of having that affect one's compositions (following the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis), having a programming langauge specific to enhancing one's compositional creativity would decrease the impact of languages on musician's compositions. A DSL can be used as a preliminary tool or a tool in conjunction with other music software. As stated above, the end goal is to let users easily think of problems other than the structure of a composition that arise when composing.

### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

I am interested in music in different ways. I take piano lessons, do chamber music, play gamelan, play jazz, and am a part of the Pomona College Orchestra. So music (at least classical and jazz) has been a large part of my life, starting when I was fairly young.

I took an independent study in composition with Prof. Alves two years ago, and I learned a couple of things. One is that all pieces, regardless of their genre, always had a plan behind them. Regardless of whether randomness is involved, I believe that almost all music depends on structure and organization. The structure doesn't have to be rigid. For example, a structure can be just 3 sections that have completely random notes, rhythms, and dynamics. However, humans tend to enjoy music they understand, and having structure helps them understand the music.

Overall, this idea is inspired by my struggles in composition, and my hope that composing can be easier for everyone.

### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._


### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look 
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_ 


### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_


### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_


### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_


## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.


### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_


### Scope
_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_


### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea 
project?_
