# Free project 3

## The user and a language
This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.

I'd like to see if it is possible to extend the work of Milo Han from last semester. He (or she?) wrote a program for sight reading. The language would serve music teachers and their students in improving their sight reading. A language might be good as it would be able to specify what kind of music one wants to sight read in order to sharpen one's weaknesses.

### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help 
them?_

Sight reading is the process of reading music without having seen the music before. Once someone reads through the music once, the music cannot be reused for sight reading. As a result, the need for a constant source of new music would be satisfied with a DSL for sight reading. We are helping music students and teachers. The current experience is to find music from the books and play through them. However, the books may contain music that is too easy or too hard. Therefore, music teachers and students tend to filter through resources to get good sight-reading material. By then, there might be little to none to help them. With our DSL, it would solve this problem and let students quickly gain skill in sight reading.


### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

A DSL is appropriate because we want the users to give input on what kind of sheet music is generated for sight reading. A language can express a lot, and this kind of detail can create sheet music tailored to individual students and their needs. It addresses the problem of finding the right kind of music to sight read.

### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

From my first project description, I explained how I am involved in music. However, I cannot sight read as well as some others. In the world of classical music, many professionals are able to sight read fairly difficult material, whereas I take time in reading the music. I sometimes blame my poor eyesight and lack of new glasses, but the main cause of my relatively poor sight reading skills comes from the lack of practice and material.

I really hope people can get good sight reading material easily that is tailored to them and free. I don't want others following my footsteps in not practicing sight reading because they didn't have enough accessible material.


### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._
Sight Reading Music Creation

### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look 
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_ 


### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_


### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_


### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_


## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.


### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_


### Scope
_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_


### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea 
project?_
