# Free project 3

## The user and a language
This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.


### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help 
them?_

A lot of people decorate their place with lights including lamps and string
lights. Those lights are already manufactured and come in only certain
styles, available at places like Ikea. I wish to change their experience by 
making it easy for them to design their own lights so that they can submit 
their own design to the manufacturers and get the customized lights.

### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

Its domain is very specific to users who want to create their own design of 
lights with ease. They would be provided with a lot of functions that let 
them customize their lights, such as the number of bulbs, bulbs wrapped in 
different shapes, mixing different shaped bulbs, length of the string, the 
voltage, etc. 

### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

I love having lights, especially string lights, on the walls at my place. 
When decorating my place, I sometimes wished for different designs of 
the lights, such as having star-shaped covers for the bulbs and other shapes 
alternate on the same string, as after some time I found the already-manufactured ones 
tedious.

### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._

Designing and customizing lights

### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look 
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_ 

It can be run on the terminal. The user would be introduced with a list of 
available functions and instructions first. 

### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_

The user can define a lights as a variable and call different functions on the
variable for different settings such as shapes, brightness, length, number of bulbs, 
etc. I imagine using Python as the domain language.  


### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

It should easy for the user to express their desire for designs of lights with
simple and intuitive language without much self-training. However, it would be
impossible/very difficult for the user to see what their design really looks 
like until they get their physical product from the manufacturer. This language
would mostly focus on allowing the user to create a "recipe" for lights so that
their customized lights can be manufactured.

### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

I've researched a little on Google, but can't seem to find anything that resembles
this idea of digitally desgining your own lights. The closest things I found are
blogs that teach you how to physically build your own lights.

## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.


### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_

Building the language aspects shouldn't be time-consuming in comparison to the
systems aspects. This is because there's only a limited number of different settings/
features/functions you can have for lights, but helping the user see digitally what 
their design would look like can be very hard.

### Scope
_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_

It's ambitious in a way that I really wish for something that can help users 
design their own lights with ease. 

### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea 
project?_

I believe this project is very domain-specific, which is a sign that it's a good
idea for a project. However, it's hard to envision in what way/how the DSL would
allow the users to see their design digitally as that would involve arranging 
some pictures such as shapes of the lights and so on.
