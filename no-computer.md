## The user and a language
This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.


### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help 
them?_

I believe Lego can be a DSL. The need for Lego is met by people's desires to
build something of their own design with lego blocks. This can be thought of 
as running a program (the end product) with pre-defined functions (the lego 
blcoks).


### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

Lego is very domain-specific, in a way that it let the users use their 
creativity to build something with ease since the lego blocks are 
pre-manufactured. 
So the user does not have to focus on the details of small pieces of their 
big picture design.

### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

As a kid, I liked building different things with Lego blocks.

Some Lego packages come with a picture of specific designs, such as 
Architecture - the White House. With those, you know from the beginning
what your end product SHOULD look like. However, I find it fun to
build my own thing and buy different Lego blocks along the way as needed.

### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._

construction with assemblarable plastic bricks

### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look 
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_ 

The user can get a package of Lego blocks made for a specific design or
get different Lego blocks separately to build their own thing. As they
design something, they can add or remove blocks if needed.

The only problem I can think of is that the user can't have smooth
curves in their design by the nature of blocks.

### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_

The user can assemble different Lego blocks since they are compatible with any 
other blocks. They fit with each other firmly and can be disassembled easily.

### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

It's easy to build anything the user wants as long as they have enough 
Lego blocks. 

It's impossible to have completely smooth lines/curves in their design, because 
the Lego blocks are plastic and shaped in a way that there's always some
space left between blocks if they are part of a gradient.

### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

There are mini Legos, that are basically the same as original Legos except
they are much smaller. 

## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.


### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_

There's a lot of room for this DSL to grow since someone can always create
new designs of Lego pieces.
