# No computer project


## The user and a language
This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.


### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help 
them?_

The need met by my idea is the need to play a large range of musical notes which
can be composed together to make music. I am helping pretty much anyone who would
want to be able to easily create music and chain notes together to create more complex
creations. Right now it is difficult to use the entire musical range. Hopefully with
my new DSL users would be able to chain together unique notes with just their finger
and have access to a large pitch range for musical compositions.

### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

A DSL is appropriate because to truly compose and play wonderful music one must be
able to effectively chain together multiple notes and be able to build off the ideas
of previous compositions. I think the best way to acheive those goals is through a DSL
since they can allow for a fluency that promotes note chaining and can use previously
made "works" easily in the program.

### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

What really excites me about this idea is using the DSL to not only play music but to
compose new music for others to play much easier than I could before.
I thought of this because I was just writing about a DSL that would help make beat
creation simpler and realised there needs to be a good way to play more than just
beats for those who are unable to use a computer. 

### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._

Complete Musical Creation and Composition. 

### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look 
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_ 

The user would interact with the language solely with touch. By pressing on
"buttons" in the language, notes will be played and multiple buttons can be pressed
to chain these notes together. Programming would be very strange. You can either
play with the buttons in which case at any moment the program could look the same
as if nothing has happened with it OR compose with it where one could note down
buttons to press so that others could use it. This is the right way to interact
with the domain because you want to be able to repeat other users' work while also
being able to restart the language design process at any point. 

### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_

A program only runs when the user presses the buttons. Then it will immediately make a
sound relative to the button pressed. The only interaction the program will have
with the user is this auditory feedback. In fact, the auditory feedback will be
the only way "errors" can be communicated to the user, mainly through the user
understanding that the auditory feedback is incorrect and that there must be something
wrong with the users language input. 

### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

Making and composing music should be very easy. Also just playing a note should be
extremely easy. It should be possible to communicate with a human through the notes
but definitely difficult for the user. It also can be difficult for the user to
remember their button combinations if they werent taking notes. All other things should
be impossible like making text or making anything outside the musical domain. 

### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

In the musical creation domain there are some other DSLs. (Voice)[https://twitter.com/NBCTheVoice] is a common DSLin this domain but it requires great vocal talent from the user and is not something that can
be learned as easily. They address the need adequately but due to the difficulties
with the language I think my DSL is a necessary improvement. Also voice can be tiring and harmful
to the vocal chords which is not good.

## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.


### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_

I think it would be split about 50/50 between language aspects and systems aspects. To make
a system that makes noise based on button presses can be tricky so less time can be spent
on the language aspects than desired. Either way this will require a lot of thought to
allow for proper fluency and chaining of notes in a way that is easy for the users.

### Scope
_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_

This is quite an ambitious project. It will require engineering design and good understanding
of what allows for easier music creation. 

### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea 
project?_

This would be a good idea for a project since it is very useful and includes lots of imaginative
language design aspects. This could be a bad idea because it requires too much engineering aspects
and could not be the optimal way to interact with music. 

On a side note, I deliberately did not mention what Non-computer my language is and I
am curious what my peer reviewer thinks it is!
