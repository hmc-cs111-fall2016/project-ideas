# No computer project


## The user and a language
This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.

The project is for users that live in dorm suites  and cannot decide what movies to watch together. A language would a be good way to solve their needs because it would structurally organize arguments in what to pick to watch. This would be much better than having suitemates bickering over a movie.

### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help 
them?_

The need to readily solve the problem of picking movies is met by the idea. We are helping people in college who live in dorm suites that need to decide what movies to watch. Current experience can involve loud arguing and bickering. The experience can be improved to reduce arguing and making everyone friendlier.


### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

A DSL would be appropriate because it would be a way for others to communicate with each other rationally. The need is addressed by using a language if everyone believes the language is fair (which will hopefully be true).

### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

My suite in Atwood sometimes has this problem, and I thought it would be interesting if we could resolve our problems without ruining our relationships by the 5th week of school.

### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._

Fair Movie Decider

### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look 
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_ 

A user would input their preferences and constraints. The programming would look like writing on paper. This would allow people in suites to quickly decide on a movie when we don't have computers.


### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_

A instance of a program would give certain movies that are possible. The program runs, giving us, the suitemates, reasonable movies. An error would occur if we break the rules of constraints and preferences (such as how many constraints we can give). The error would have to be analyzed by the users.


### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

It should be easy to eliminate choices and express preferences. It should be hard to completely dominate the choice of the final movie.

### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

There might be, but nothing that doesn't use computers. I believe this because nobody probably formalized something like picking movies in a college dorm suite amongst argumentative, bickering suitemates. 

## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.

I do not think it would make a good idea as the scope is too limiting. However, this is also because I do not have a clear idea of the language.

### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_

Almost all their time would be spent making design choices to make the output fair and reasonably ok amongst all people in the suite.

### Scope
_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_

This idea is fairly small and is not that ambitious. 

### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea 
project?_

This is a good idea because it is something that would incite many design discussions. However, I think this is very limited in scope.
