# No computer project: Badminton doubles hand-signals


## The user and a language
This section describes what the no-computer DSL is and who uses it

The fastest sport in the world. The only time badminton doubles players drop from that intensity is to serve, and it's one of the most important aspects of doubles. It dictates which side will have the advantage from the start, and the key part to serving well is communication between partners. But they can't just talk to each other, othewise the opponents would know exactly what they are about to do. Enter the DSL: hand signs behind the back. 

The serving player stands in the front and uses these hand signs to let the partner at the back know which specific "play" they will use. While it's not nearly as complicated as a play in football or basketball - as there are only two players on each side - it is much more subtle.  

### What's the need?
_What need is met by this DSL? Who benefits? What would that person's experience be like without it? What would their experience be like with this DSL?
them?_

What do players gain from knowing exactly what serve his/her partner will use? In doubles badminton, the player serves from the frontcourt usually to the opponent's frontcourt to prevent the opponent from getting the upper hard (being able to attack with a smash). But occasionally, trick serves are used to catch the opponent off guard or to force an error. The most common one is a lob serve, which looks just like a normal serve, except at the last moment when the server flicks it just over the head of the opponent. This forces the opponent to have to prepare for both a high and a low shot. If he/she can anticipate this shot then he/she can easily jump and smash, intercepting the shuttle at an early and high point. Rally over. 

The general rule in doubles is that when you lift (hit a high shot), partners move from the front/back position to a side/side position to cover as much area of the court as possible and allow for more reaction time. This is why it is so important to signal to your partner where you intend to serve so that the team can be well-prepared for the rally without losing the element of surprise. 

Without these important hand-signs your partner could be surprised and you may easily lose the rally. 

### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_
As I mentioned before it prepares your partner for the next shot, giving you the best chance of winning the point. 

### Why you?
_What excites you about this DSL? How did you come up with it?_
I grew up playing competitive badminton at the provincial and national level (some of my friends continue to play professionally) so when a classmate mentioned the act of hailing a taxi as a DSL I immediately thought of this. The thrill of intense, long rallies in badminton is incomparable to anything else. It gives you this incredibly giddy feeling. 

### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._
Communicating secretly in badminton doubles

### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? What does using the DSL look 
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_ 

We used to have multiple different signals: 1 for a regular serve, 2 for a high serve, 3 for a serve to the side etc. Serving to the side would catch the opponent off guard and limits the angles that they can return (although it is slightly slower so it cannot be constantly used). If done right, your partner can also shift over to put even more pressure on the opponent to hit an inch-perfect shot (forcing errors). Even if we were doing a normal serve, it's important to continue the habit of giving the hand sign to maintain the deception. 

There's no wrong way to communicate in badminton, just that if you let the opponent know what you're going to do beforehand, you're not going to win the point. So this is definitely the best method for serving. 

### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_

N/A

### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_
N/A

### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

In the domain of hand-signs there are quite a number of "DSL's" as there are many different forms of sign language. In terms of sports, all forms of refereeing could also be considered DSL's.
