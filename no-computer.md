## The user and a language
This section describes what the non-computer DSL is and who uses it.

Abacuses are a DSL for calculating numbers and storying numbers. It is a DSL for
people that do not have calculators, for people that want to develop their
arithmetic abilities, and was the main calculating tool for millions of people
for thousands of years (until electronic calculators became a thing).

### What's the need?
_What need is met by this DSL? Who does it help? What is that person's
experience like before using this DSL? What would their experience be like after
they started using this DSL?_

The needs were obvious in the before-calculators age. It has a simple system
that can represent large numbers, and it speeds up things like accounting work.
The experiences of people before abacus was probably tedious, having to write or
memorize numbers on their way to a calculation (and it's not like they did not
calculate large things back then!). After they created the abacus, people can
do those calculations much easier and faster.

The current use of abacus is largely educational. Many kindergarten and primary
school age children in places like China and Japan learn the abacus to practice
and improve their arithmetic abilities. So the need here is an abstraction to
learning and practicing arithmetic, which reinforces the arithmetic its users
learn in use. The abacus does this fairly well as it is entertaining to little
children and is an effective tool to reinforce their arithmetic skills.

### Why a language?
_Why was this DSL appropriate for its users? How does it address the need?_

The abacus is extremely appropriate for its users. Users in the times before did
not need to learn how to read to use the abacus, they just needed to understand
how to do arithmetic. The abacus helped them do the calculations and keep track
of the results.


### Why you?
_Why do you think this is a DSL?  How did you come up with it?_

I was thinking about what I liked to do and how things were taught and how
people looked at it back home in China. I really like doing math and remembered
that abacus was a popular extra-curricular that kids did that I did not do! I
did not do worse than the kids that learned the abacus in arithmetic. However,
after thinking about it thoroughly, the abacus definitely reinforces your brain
in calculating numbers and so forth. Its uses in the before-calculator times are
relatively obvious.

### Domain
_Describe the DSL's domain in five words._

Speedy calculation of multiple numbers.

### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? How does using it look
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_

The user interacts it by moving the different beads on the abacus. Depending on
the abacus, different beads refer to different things. Usually, each bead refers
to one of some unit. So you could have the right-most rod have beads the refer
to the 1s, where one bead on the bottom of the rod means 1, and the two beds on
the top row of that rod mean 5 each. Thus it covers the whole spectrum of 10.
The rod to its left would be for the 10s place, each lower row bead being 10,
with a top row bead for that rod being 50. When adding, you move the correct
beads that represent the numbers being added, etc.

### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_

The abacus doesn't do anything to/for the user except keep numbers as is so that
the user can think about other things in the mean time. The only kind of errors
that can occur are human calculation errors. For example, if someone puts in the
wrong number at the beginning, no amount of calculating will fix the siatuoin
until the user figures out they put in the wrong number.

### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

Calculating numbers and not changing the number on the abacus until someone
touches it shoudl be easy. More complex arithmetic/mathematical operations like
exponents should be possible (there are tricks to doing them), but they are very
difficult for the common user. Non-mathematical things should be impossible or
very difficult to do.

### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

Yes there are other DSLs in this domain. There are written numbers and so forth.
Mathemaics were being done all over areas that invented or used the abacus. The
issue with that is that often, these kind of mathematics was not accessible to
the common person. The common person was often illiterate when the abacus was
used, and so could not participate in writing down mathematics (until the Arabic
way of representing numbers became popular in most of the world). The abacus
could be taught and mastered by people who cannot read, and that was a big part.

In modern uses, there are also other DSLs in the domain of practicing
arithmetic, especially for kids. Some of them are quite fancy, with computer
programs and such that make it "fun" to practice math. However, the abacus
remains accessible as ever, where you don't need an expensive computer or IPad
to use it.

The admirable qualities is how simple it is and its easy-of-learning. Even kids
can learn it within a day (mastering it is another story, of course).

For its purposes in the past and now, there are not any parts that could be
improved without simply making it a TI-84.

### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_
