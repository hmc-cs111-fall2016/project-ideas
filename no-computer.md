# No computer project


## The user and a language
This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.


### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help 
them?_
My non-computer DSL would be hitchhiking/hailing taxis. This was needed before
Uber and apps to signal to taxis and drivers that you needed a ride. It is a
very simple language, with very few ways to signal, but it is very effective and
widely recognized.
I would create a few more indicators: 
	- I am extremely desperate, will pay double.
	- I have card only
	- Default I just need a cab 
This would make it more efficient.

### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_
A language is certainly needed to communicate, even for this single purpose.

### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_
I used to take cabs often back home in Singapore, and drivers would often refuse
to stop for no reason. It would be great if I could signal that I would tip or
pay extra in rushed times.

### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._
Better language for hailing cabs.

### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look 
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_ 
A user sticks their hand out in a variety of ways. I imagine different angles
of the arm. It is a good way because it needs to be clear and quick as people
are driving when looking for hailing cabs.

### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_
When a program runs, a cab may or may not stop if one passes by. Errors will be
responded to with a guaranteed no-stop by a cab. 


### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_
Should be easy to hail a cab. It should be impossible to do everything else,
it is a very limited set of language features.

### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_
Yes, the current way of hailing cabs.  I think it could be improved by adding
more indications of desperation/willingness to pay extra so cab drivers cannot
ignore without feeling guilty.

## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.


### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_
100% of time will be spent on language.

### Scope
_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_
It is ambitious to expect all people to take this idea on and learn the language.

### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea 
project?_
Probably not a great idea for a project.  Could be good if you are the president
of some taxicab company, but otherwise it is almost pointless to pursue.
