# No computer project


## The user and a language
This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.

A DSL for describing people by appearence.  This would be useful so that when you see someone
you could describe more accurately what they look like to your friends. This
could also be a useful way to report suspicious people the the authorities if
there was a specific language for describing people in an organized manner.

### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help 
them?_

I would be helping people who have difficulty describing people.  It can be very
difficult to explain to people what someone looks like and what differentiates
their looks from other people.


### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

A DSL is appropriate because it is a very focused domain: people.  A langauge is
nice because it is a convenient way to share information.

### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

I came up with the idea because I've heard many people describing other people
when they can't remember someone's name and often the descriptions are very
vague.  

### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._

Describe people's appeareance precisely

### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look 
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_ 

A user would interact by the language by hearing a description or creating a
description of someone.

### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_

I would interpret this question as someone using the DSL to describe someone.
This would look like expressing characteristics of the individual in an ordered
fashion.

### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

It should be easy to express different aspects of people such as eye color
height, and other such physical attributes.  It should be impossible or very
difficult to describe non physical attributes since this langauge should allow
you too identify people described to you just by sight.

### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

Well people already do this in English but the reason for the DSL would be to
improve the format of describing a person.

## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.

I do not think this would make a very good CS 111 project since there is pretty
minimal programming and I doubt people would favor this over the already familiar
English explanations of people.

### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_

I think that this project is pretty much 100% language design.

### Scope
_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_

Hmmm I'm not sure.  I think it has a relatively wide scope since there are many
physical attributes that define people's appearence and that these can look very
similar with slight differences.  There would be design decisions about what level
of detail would be useful for describing a person vs what level of detail would
be too intricate for a listener to really remember everything and differentiate
each detail.

### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea 
project?_

It would be a good project because it has pretty much just design choices to make
and doesn't require too much implementation work.  It's a pretty bad project
becuase it doesn't require the comptuer and I'm not sure how pressing a need there
is for it.
